\subsubsection{MPC: Practical Issues}

%NOTE: Tracking, Disturbance rejection, Feasible Set

\subsection{Learning Objectives}

- Understand difference between MPC for tracking and regulation

- Formulate MPC tracking problem

- Address constant disturbances to achieve offset-free tracking/regulation

- Analyze MPC without terminal set

- Formulate soft-constrained MPC problem and understand its properties

\subsection{Reference Tracking}


%NOTE: MPC Formulation with U star

\subsubsection{Steady-state Target Problem}

- The reference is achieved by the target
state $xs if z_s = Hx_s = r$

- Target state should be a steady-state,
such that there exists an input that
keeps system at target, i.e. $x_s = Ax_s + Bu_s$
