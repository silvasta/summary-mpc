## Recap - End of Robust MPC

- constraint-tightening
- tube

## Stochastic MPC

**Goal**
Develop s.t. it accounts for **random noise**,
exploit distribution of noise

- understand constrained stochastic problems
- understand stability concepts

### Stochastic dynamics

$$
x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k) = w(k)
$$

with $w(k)$ independent
and distributed with $Q^w$,
$E[w(k)] = 0$, var$(w(k)) = \Sigma_w$

### Stochastic setting

**New**:
$P(x(k) \in X) \ge p$ and $ w(k) ~ Q^w$

**Example** Segway:
use linear feedback to reduce possible spread

### Mean-Variance Prediction Dynamics

use linear feedback
$u(k) = K(x(k)-\hat(x)_k) + u_k$
with mean $\hat(x) = E[x(k)]$

stochastic dynamics characterized by mean and variance

### Objective

just expectation of regular P,Q,R cost

<!-- TODO: formula E|Q|= ... -->

$$
E[l(x,u)] = E[...]
$$

xQ uR + mean x,u + something with variance

### Constrained stochastic optimal control problem

<!-- HACK: add to MPC summary -->

## Asymptotic Average Performance bounds

- some Lyapunov
- cost for N to infinity

## MPC under Additive Disturbances: Robust vs. Stochastic

1. Show Lyapunov-like decrease for Asymptotic Average Performance bound
2. Apply this to cost function decrease
3. derive tractable solution

### Lyapunov-like decrease

Apply **law of iterated expectation**

$\mathcal{E}(V(x(k+1))|x(0)) - V(x(0))$

<!-- TODO: check iterated expectation -->

### Asymptotic Average Performance: Unconstrained MPC

- show expected cost
- Nominal vs Stochastic
  - everything with expectation + C
  - C bounds average performance

### Tractable Case

$tr(P\Sigma_w)$

## Summary

- formulate constrained stochastic optimal control problem

- stability and convergence
  - Asymptotic average performance
  - sufficient Lyapunov conditions
  - stochastic satisfies conditions
