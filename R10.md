# Stochastic

- EXAM: which set for what? PRS for Stochastic
- GP: pays with computational complexity, for each data point

## approximation of normal distribution

**Challenge**
Distribution can change a lot under non-linear systems

**Idea**
approximate distribution of states as Gaussian,
propagate its mean and covariance trough non-linear system

## prediction from uncertain inputs

Assume input becomes uncertain according to model uncertain distribution

**Goal** approximate joint Gaussian distribution

- set correlation/orso to 0

<!-- NOTE: somehow same as before? -->

## Gaussian Processes

- variance gets low, but is weight for next update, problem when changes

## finit basis function approximation

- rewrite parameter dynamics as dynamic system
- use kalman filter to solve that

<!-- HACK: slide with kalman for exercise 7 -->

## Guarantees

- BLR
